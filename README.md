# WeatherApp
project for Awesome Inc, uses OpenWeatherMap API

This program is designed to provide a simple 5-day forecast of the weather.
The API OpenWeatherMap provides all data for this program. More details can
be consulted on their website https://openweathermap.org/ 

----- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS -----

Enter in a city name and a corresponding country code (such as US for the 
United States, FR for France, etc.). The OWP can autofill country data for
larger cities, but this program requires a code to be entered.

To retrieve data, press the "Go" button after entering data. If a new unit
system is desired after entering in a city, the Go button must be pressed again.
OWP only provides data up to the afternoon of the 5th day.

To reset data, simply enter in a new city into the text boxes and press Go again.

The program can be executed through the included jar file.
